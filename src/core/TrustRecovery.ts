/**
 * TrustRecovery — clear recovery path after trust incidents.
 *
 * Part of Phase 4 of the Adaptive Autonomy System (Improvement 10).
 *
 * After an incident drops trust, the system tracks a recovery streak.
 * After N successful operations post-incident (configurable, default: 10),
 * the agent surfaces a recovery message suggesting restoration of
 * the previous trust level.
 *
 * The recovery path is transparent: the agent tells the user exactly
 * what happened, what the track record is since, and what it suggests.
